# Benchtop Power Supply
What better way to get back in to work with your own personal benchtop power supply.  Uses a LM317 for power output and provides a separate 5V rail. You will need a power supply rated higher than what you want to power ( use laptop power supply if you have one)

* In this project we have allowed you to select your own power sockets and knob for the adjust. You could use the same [PS042X](https://jaycar.com.au/p/PS0421) series that we have, or use something like the [PT045X](https://jaycar.com.au/p/PT0454) series. The choice is really up to you.
